# UFO: The Game
Codecademy C++ Project where you can stop an alien abduction by correcting guessing the codeword in this fanciful version of hangman. 

## Overview
**UFO: The Game** is a fun and interactive command-line game developed in C++. The premise of the game is simple: invaders from outer space are abducting humans, and it's up to the players to save them by cracking the codeword. This game is inspired by the classic game "Hangman" but with a unique twist.

## Features
- ASCII art for visualizing the UFO abduction process.
- Dynamic feedback based on player's input.
- Incremental difficulty as the game progresses.

## How to Play
1. Run the game in your terminal.
2. You will be greeted with the game instructions.
3. Guess the letters of the hidden codeword to save your friend from alien abduction.
4. Be cautious! More than 7 incorrect guesses, and the UFO will complete its abduction.
